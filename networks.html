								 NBA basketball/mentoring program in Phokeng, South Africa. For two to three hours a day, five days a week, three retired NBA players
								 mentor a dozen youth, giving them one-on-one attention as well as group training through basketball. The program teaches essential 
								 life lessons such as the importance of teamwork, confidence, self esteem, motivation and exercise. Princess Tirelo admits that the

								 Princess Tirelo is passionate about inspiring the youth and helping them discover their authentic selves. The NBA program led by her 
								 brother, King Kgosi Leruo Molotlegi, has changed the lives of students in remarkable ways. Princess Tirelo and her family have big 
								 plans on expanding the program and getting more NBA involvement with the goal of engaging, educating and inspiring these future 
								 leaders to discover what makes them authentically special. To help them grow, one can donate to support education in Africa through 
								 Thuto Thebe Educational Trust, volunteer their program design or business development skills, or become a strategic partner.
