          The Queen Mother of the Royal Bafokeng nation, Dr Semane Molotlegi, hosted a charity polo match with her Daughter Tirelo Molotlegi. 
          The event was in association with Motsweding FM, La Martina and Aveng Grinaker-LTA and featured top international, South African 
          and African polo players. Matches of three players a side are played on smaller grass fields that are fully boarded all around. 
          The curtain raiser is a three-a-side match featuring two international women who have represented both South Africa and Zimbabwe, 
          playing alongside top male international players. Princess Tirelo Molotlegi of the Royal Bafokeng said this was the first time 
          action polo would be played in the North West and proceeds from the cup will go to The Girl Guides Association of SA and Thuto Thebe Educational Fund.

                            weights isn’t a chore to clean out a closet – it’s what saved her life. Walcott was not always a world-champion powerlifter. Born and raised in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Walcott was active throughout her childhood and adolescence.
                
                            Her life hit a turning point when she decided to start living for her two kids rather than herself. At the time that she made this decision, she had reached around 450 pounds. She then started going to the gym in 2016, and in that first year alone, she lost 100 pounds.  
                            
                            Walcott admits, “I felt like I was slowly dying, and I needed to do something, and the easiest thing was to go to a gym because most of them are open 24 hours, and that's kind of what I did. So I walked into a gym, I saw people lifting, and boom, I fell in love.”
